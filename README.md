# Code for the Bacherlor Thesis "Few-shot Learning Using Orthogonal Convolutions"

in this repository you can find the implementations of three ways to make the convolution to be orthogonal for the few-shot learning pipeline

to train a model you have to set up arguments in the `config.py` and then run `python3 main.py`

to evaluate a model you have to set up arguments in the `config.py` and then run `python3 eval_fewshot.py`

some parts of the code are based on:
